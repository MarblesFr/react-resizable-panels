## react-resizable-panels

This fork of react-resizable-panels makes a few changes:
* panel sizes are now given in pixels instead of percentages
* panels can be given a defaultSize of '*', this will result in them taking up the rest of the space
* when panels are resized they will take the space from the panel with the defaultSize of '*', instead of the neighbouring panels
